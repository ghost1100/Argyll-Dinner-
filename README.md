Argyll Dinner

This was my first ever website, created as a college project. The tech stack includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It doesn’t use a database; instead, booking data is saved to local storage.

I still remember stressing over this project and the deadline. At the time, I was new to software engineering and had taken a HNC in college as a crash course. Back then, ChatGPT didn’t exist yet—it only became mainstream towards the end of my HND.

My professor was very strict and demanding, which, in hindsight, pushed me to develop faster and achieve things I didn’t think I could. I was also lucky to have the support of my two classmates, who are now close friends. They helped me debug my code, understand why certain things weren’t working, and explore alternative approaches. I’m forever grateful to them.
