this was my first ever website, it's a college project, techstack is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
it doesn't use any form of database and instead saves booking data into local storage, funny enough i remember back when I was stressing over this project and the deadline mainly because
I was new to software engineering and took upm HNC in college as a crash course, I recall that back then ChatGPT was not a thing it only became what it is during the end of my HND, my Professor at the time was very strict and demanding which 
Helped me develop faster and pushed me to work harder achiving things I couldn't even imagine at the time and luckily back then my 2 classmates and close friends now helped me figure out the bugs in my code why things were not functioning as they were supposed to and what other methods I could use or where to look if I wanted to learn about doing things differently I am forever grateful to them all.

to run this project in the simplest of manners.
start by downloading vs code, add the extention live server and right click on the splash html file and run live server it should automatically launch the template in your default browser.
we all start somewhere and this was my humble beginings.
